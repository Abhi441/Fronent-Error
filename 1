What is a 404 error? How do you fix it?
A 404 error is an HTTP status code that indicates that the server was unable to find the 
page or resource that the user requested. This error occurs when the user tries to access a URL that does not exist on 
the server, or the server is unable to locate the requested page.

There are several ways to fix a 404 error:

Check the spelling and capitalization of the URL. Make sure that you have typed the URL correctly and that it is properly formatted.
Try accessing the page from a different device or web browser. This will help you determine if the problem is with the device or browser that you are using.
Clear your browser cache and cookies. This can help resolve issues with the browser's stored data.
Check for any typos or errors in the URL.
Try accessing the page using a different internet connection. If the problem is with your internet connection, switching to a different connection may help.
Contact the website administrator if you continue to experience issues. They may be able to help you troubleshoot the problem or provide more information about the issue.
If none of these solutions help, it is possible that the page or resource that you are trying to access has been removed or moved to a different location. In this case, you may need to search for the information that you are looking for on the website or try to find it elsewhere.
